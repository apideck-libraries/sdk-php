# GeneralLedgerTransactionSourceType

The originating transaction type that produced this posting in the general ledger. Discriminates whether the entry came from an invoice, a bill, a payment, a manual journal, etc. This is the key field that distinguishes general-ledger-transactions from journal-entries (which only covers manually-captured entries). May be `null` when the upstream connector did not return an origin discriminator (e.g. Xero's single-record endpoint strips `SourceType` for every record; certain historical records also omit it). To recover a populated value, query the list endpoint.
